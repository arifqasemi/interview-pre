################### all practice #############

############# focus on these ####################
Array manipulation (e.g., reversing, rotating, or finding subarrays).
String processing (e.g., palindrome checks, substring search).
Dynamic programming (noted as a favorite at Odoo).
Basic data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, or hash maps).

Week 1: Core Topics
Day 1: Arrays (Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, Contains Duplicate) – 3 problems.
Day 2: Strings (Valid Anagram, Valid Palindrome, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters) – 3 problems.
Day 3: Stacks (Valid Parentheses, Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation, Min Stack) – 3 problems.
Day 4: Hash Maps (Group Anagrams, Top K Frequent Elements, Find Pairs with a Given Sum) – 3 problems.
Day 5: Sorting (Implement Quicksort, Sort Colors, Merge Sort Implementation) – 3 problems.
Day 6: Binary Search (Binary Search, Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Find First and Last Position) – 3 problems.
Day 7: SQL (Combine Two Tables, Second Highest Salary) + ERD (design a course platform schema) – 2 problems + 1 ERD.
Week 2: Advanced Topics + Review
Day 8: Linked Lists (Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Linked List Cycle) – 3 problems.
Day 9: Trees (Binary Tree Inorder Traversal, Maximum Depth, Validate BST) – 3 problems.
Day 10: Dynamic Programming (Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Coin Change) – 3 problems.
Day 11: Recursion (Subsets, Permutations, Letter Combinations) – 3 problems.
Day 12: Graphs (Number of Islands, Course Schedule, implement DFS/BFS) – 3 problems.
Day 13: Mock Test – Solve 4 problems in 80 minutes (e.g., Two Sum, Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation, Maximum Subarray, Combine Two Tables).
Day 14: Review weak areas + solve 2–3 Top 150 problems (e.g., Reverse String, Move Zeroes).



############### Do Top 150 as much as you can ##################
