 *             CODERBYTE QUESTIONS MARKS CHALLENGE              *

 * Problem Statement                                            *
 * Have the function QuestionsMarks(str) which takes the str    *
 * string parameter, which will contain single digit numbers,   *
 * letters, & question marks, & check if there are exactly 3    *
 * question marks between every pair of two numbers that add up *
 * to 10. If so, then your program should return the string     *
 * true, otherwise it should return the string false. If there  *
 * aren't any two numbers that add up to 10 in the string, then *
 * your program should return false as well.                    *
 *                                                              *
 * Test Cases                                                   *
 * For example: if str is "arrb6???4xxbl5???eee5" then your     *
 * program should return true because there are exactly 3       *
 * question marks between 6 and 4, and 3 question marks between *
 * 5 and 5 at the end of the string.                            *
 *                                                              *
