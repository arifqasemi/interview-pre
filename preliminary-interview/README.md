### Technical Test
1. demonestrating my project: first, I'd like to start with a brief overview of this project before diving into the details. this is an API that is built using django python framework backend by Postresql database,designed to serve my app. the API manages the posts,product,reels,works,stories,reivews,comments,likes,views,following users,and hashtags. has a clean and maintainable architecture,  and leverages Django's robust ORM for efficient and reliable data modeling. obviously this not the only backend. i have two more backends that serves the app. let's start exploring with the data modeling from comment model .... and let's see who the relation look on the other side.


### TIPS
1. have clear introduction on what you have done and acheived so far.
2. say this to demonestrate enthusiasm "since i don't have experience Odoo frameworks, i have already explored Odoo frameworks through documentations
and i am commited to dadicate the time and efforts required to master in short time because based on my research it is quite similar to Django which i have a strong background in."
3. state that i have EILTS certification
4. talk like you feel it.
